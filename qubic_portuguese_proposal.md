## 🌍 Why This Matters to the Qubic Ecosystem

Brazil is one of the world's leading countries in crypto adoption. Portuguese is spoken by more than 250 million people. Yet, Qubic has **almost no educational presence** in this language. This proposal fills a critical gap in outreach and education, making Qubic more accessible to an entire region of potential users, miners, validators, and developers.

---

## 🧮 Cost Efficiency

- Estimated workload: 40 hours/week (~160/month)
- Cost/hour: ~$5.62 (extremely low compared to $40–$100 industry rate)
- Video + community + onboarding + strategy = bundled for low cost

---

## 🔁 Long-Term Sustainability

Once this first year is complete, the project will become **self-sustaining** through YouTube monetization, community support, and voluntary contributions. The goal is to **continue indefinitely**, growing alongside Qubic.
